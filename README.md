# Walrust
Open-source terminal-based wallpaper changer for Hyprpaper written in Rust

Note: Walrust is currently in active development, the software is not yet ready for use.

## TODO
- **Configuration System** (Customize wallpaper path, UI color, etc.) **[WIP]**
- **Recursive Wallpaper Listing** (List wallpapers from subdirectories within the wallpaper path)
